# A Star Route Planner

This project is part of the four projects that I will be completing, that are part of the nano-degree program.   In this project, OpenStreet Map data is used  by the IO2D library.  
Another library utilizes the IO2D library, this is used to communicate with the IO2D library.  This library is then used in the A Star search that i will code, to create a path between two points in the map.
